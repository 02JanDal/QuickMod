    "description": "In the Myst series, there are special books that describe wild and varied new worlds, called Ages. These Ages can be written with a special language, and the books they are written in can be used to visit those Ages. Some ages can be beautiful and safe, while others can be inherently unstable and dangerous.\\n\\nMystcraft brings the ability to write Ages to Minecraft, allowing players to create and explore wild new worlds for adventure, settlement, or material gain. When playing with such powerful forces, powerful dangers will also be present. Players must always ensure they have a way home, and must endure harsh conditions in unstable ages or learn how to write safer ages to inhabit.",
