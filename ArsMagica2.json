It features a unique spell creation system where you can create any spell you can imagine!</em>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <em>Interested in playing on a public server with this and many other magic-themed mods?</em>\n    <br/>\n    <a href=\"http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2028729-arcanacraft-a-magic-themed-minecraft-server/\">\n      <em>Got you covered.</em>\n    </a>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <img alt=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mq2TlG57psI/UloXApj2zwI/AAAAAAAAAXM/Q7cDeEGN5ss/s475/getting_started.png\" title=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mq2TlG57psI/UloXApj2zwI/AAAAAAAAAXM/Q7cDeEGN5ss/s475/getting_started.png\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mq2TlG57psI/UloXApj2zwI/AAAAAAAAAXM/Q7cDeEGN5ss/s475/getting_started.png\"/>\n    <br/>\n    <em>T</em>\n    <em>aking your first steps.</em>\n  </p>\n  <p>Getting started in AM2 is quite simple to do. First, you need to find a pool of liquid essence:<br/>\n    <img alt=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-RUV6q0PcQVw/Uloaur_P0YI/AAAAAAAAAYQ/xaq3G4NLUu4/s200/essencePool.png\" title=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-RUV6q0PcQVw/Uloaur_P0YI/AAAAAAAAAYQ/xaq3G4NLUu4/s200/essencePool.png\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-RUV6q0PcQVw/Uloaur_P0YI/AAAAAAAAAYQ/xaq3G4NLUu4/s200/essencePool.png\"/>\n    <br/>Place an item frame within a few blocks of the pool, and put a book into the item frame, and watch the show.This will give you the Arcane Compendium, which has everything you need to continue using the mod, from guides, to structures, to items, to bosses.<br/>\n    <img alt=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Id9fj1KmJ3s/UlobXIqFEaI/AAAAAAAAAYo/va25ClhllOk/s400/bookXMute.png\" title=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Id9fj1KmJ3s/UlobXIqFEaI/AAAAAAAAAYo/va25ClhllOk/s400/bookXMute.png\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Id9fj1KmJ3s/UlobXIqFEaI/AAAAAAAAAYo/va25ClhllOk/s400/bookXMute.png\"/>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <img alt=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-I7TLexgqd5o/UloXAmbr3pI/AAAAAAAAAXA/_vAyooJZ4jA/s169/faq.png\" title=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-I7TLexgqd5o/UloXAmbr3pI/AAAAAAAAAXA/_vAyooJZ4jA/s169/faq.png\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-I7TLexgqd5o/UloXAmbr3pI/AAAAAAAAAXA/_vAyooJZ4jA/s169/faq.png\"/>\n    <br/>\n    <em>I have a question... (bug reporting instructions too)</em>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>I found a bug!</strong>\n    <br/>That's great. The forum however, isn't the place to post them. You can post them on the git bug tracker. Check to see if a bug has been posted already before submitting yours! Link: <a href=\"https://github.com/Mithion/ArsMagica2\">https:<em>github.com/M.../issues</em>\n    </a>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>This mod crashed / This mod doesn't work with X other mod! It's a bug, etc.</strong>\n    <br/>Very unlikely. Typically these are simply block ID conflicts or some such other thing. Make sure you check your log file, it tells you exactly what the conflict was. If it turns out it's not a conflict, see above.</p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Something Something Something Textures</strong>\n    <br/>Just don't. I can't stress enough how little I care.</p>\n  <p>\n    <img alt=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-UN6rQRYUGvc/UloXBKjKijI/AAAAAAAAAXQ/tOGs6iB1rQI/s331/modpacks.png\" title=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-UN6rQRYUGvc/UloXBKjKijI/AAAAAAAAAXQ/tOGs6iB1rQI/s331/modpacks.png\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-UN6rQRYUGvc/UloXBKjKijI/AAAAAAAAAXQ/tOGs6iB1rQI/s331/modpacks.png\"/>\n    <br/>\n    <em>No PMs please! Details below.</em>\n  </p>\n  <p>So here's the deal. You want Ars Magica in your mod pack? All you need to meet are three simple conditions:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li/>\n    <li>Your mod pack needs a link back to this forum post</li>\n    <li>You cannot make any money off of the mod pack</li>\n    <li>You cannot claim that you made any part of the mod, and you must give credit to the author of the mod (Mithion)<br/>\n      <br/>If these three conditions are met, then you have my permission to use it in a mod pack. Have fun!</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n",
