Everything should work as you'd expect!</p>\n  <p>How do you edit a sign? You right-click a sponge or sponge wipe on it.</p>\n  <p>To make a sponge (which is usually only available in creative mode), simply throw <strong>yellow wool</strong> into water or onto the ground when it's raining. It'll soak up the water. <em>SHLOOP!</em> You have a sponge!</p>\n  <p>The problem with sponge is that it's not very durable. The solution? You make it into sponge wipes! Simply craft a sponge with a piece of cactus green (to give it a rougher side) et voil√†: you have something akin to a steel-wool pad!</p>\n  <p>You can also place sponge beside a sign (without editing it) by sneaking while placing the sponge. It won't be \"used\" but will, instead, appear as a block.</p>\n  <h2 id=\"w-recipes\">Recipes</h2>\n  <p>See the <a href=\"http://wiki.feed-the-beast.com/FlatSigns#Recipes\">FTB wiki page</a>.</p>\n  <h2 id=\"w-other-mods-by-me\">Other Mods by Me</h2>\n  <p>You can find a list in my <a href=\"http://smarturl.it/Myrathi\">Mod Compendium</a> on the FTB forum or on my <a href=\"http://minecraft.curseforge.com/profiles/myrathi2\">CurseForge profile</a>.</p>\n</div>\n",
