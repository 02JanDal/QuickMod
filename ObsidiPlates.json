    "description": "<div class=\"project-description height-limit text no-tooltip\">\n  <h2 id=\"w-overview\">Overview</h2>\n  <p>\n    <strong>ObsidiPlates</strong> is a mod, by <a href=\"http://wiki.feed-the-beast.com/User:Myrathi\">Myrathi</a>, providing pressure plates that can only be activated by either players or NPCs, depending on what they're made of.</p>\n  <p>Originally created as a surprise for <a href=\"http://wiki.feed-the-beast.com/User:Jadedcat\">Jadedcat</a>, it implements (using original code) a concept she missed from Better Than Wolves (which is why the primary plates uses obsidian, specifically).</p>\n  <h5 id=\"w-minecraft-1-6-2\">Minecraft 1.6.2</h5>\n  <p>\n    <strong>v2.0.0 build 15</strong> is a straight 1.6.2 port of <strong>build 13</strong>.</p>\n  <h5 id=\"w-minecraft-1-5-2\">Minecraft 1.5.2</h5>\n  <p>As of <strong>v1.5.0 build 13</strong>, <strong>Silent</strong> and <strong>Shrouded</strong> Plates can be smelted, in a furnace, to remove the extra properties, returning a basic <strong>Obsidian</strong> or <strong>Mossy</strong> Pressure Plate.</p>\n  <h5 id=\"w-minecraft-1-5-1\">Minecraft 1.5.1</h5>\n  <p>As of <strong>v1.3.2 build 11</strong>, <a href=\"http://wiki.feed-the-beast.com/User:Myrathi\">Myrathi</a> added five (5) more plates:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <strong>Mossy Pressure Plates</strong>: made with mossy cobblestone, instead of obsidian, can only be activated by NPCs.</li>\n    <li>\n      <strong>Silent</strong> versions: made by crafting an <strong>Obsidian</strong> or <strong>Mossy Pressure Plate</strong> over a block of wool, disables the clicking sound.</li>\n    <li>\n      <strong>Shrouded</strong> versions: made from <strong>Noisy</strong> or <strong>Silent</strong>, <strong>Obsidian</strong> or <strong>Mossy Pressure Plates</strong>, by alternating nether quartz and glowstone dust around the plate in the crafting grid, makes them almost entirely transparent.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <h5 id=\"w-minecraft-1-4-6-1-4-7\">Minecraft 1.4.6/1.4.7</h5>\n  <p>Earlier versions of <strong>ObsidiPlates</strong> only had the single <strong>Obsidian Pressure Plate</strong> available.</p>\n  <h2 id=\"w-how-it-works\">How It Works</h2>\n  <p>All plates are a type of switch that can be placed onto the surface of a block. If connected, by wire, to an object (or placed adjacent to a block that can be powered), it will provide power to that object or block when stepped on by a player (or NPC, if a <strong>Mossy Pressure Plate</strong>) and will stop when stepped off.</p>\n  <p>As opposed to wooden and stone pressure plates, <strong>Obsidian Pressure Plate</strong>s <em>will not</em> respond to items or NPCs and <strong>Mossy Cobblestone Plates</strong>\n    <em>will not</em> respond to items or players.</p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Silent</strong> versions of these plates make no sound.</p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Shrouded</strong> versions of these plates are see-through.</p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Silent</strong> and <strong>Shrouded</strong> plates can only be be crafted as silent first then adding shrouded last.</p>\n  <h2 id=\"w-recipes\">Recipes</h2>\n  <p>See the <a href=\"http://wiki.feed-the-beast.com/ObsidiPlates#Recipes\">FTB wiki page</a>.</p>\n  <h2 id=\"w-other-mods-by-me\">Other Mods by Me</h2>\n  <p>You can find a list in my <a href=\"http://smarturl.it/Myrathi\">Mod Compendium</a> on the FTB forum or on my <a href=\"http://minecraft.curseforge.com/profiles/myrathi2\">CurseForge profile</a>.</p>\n</div>\n",
