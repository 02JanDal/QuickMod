    "description": "A few months ago I started tinkering with Minecraft modding as a way to better learn java. I had no serious intentions of ever making a proper mod so I basically threw in every silly and stupid idea that came to me. Most didn't work or were impractical for a real server but there were a few that I felt had potential and even some that I heard other users wishing they had. So I've decided to take the best ideas, polish it up and release it to the community and see if anyone else likes it.",
