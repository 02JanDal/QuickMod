It allows you to build in-game Computers and Turtle Robots, and write programs for them using the Lua programming language. The addition of programming to Minecraft opens up a wide variety of new possibilities for automation and creativity. If you’ve never programmed before, it also serves as excellent way to learn a real world skill in a fun, familiar environment.</p>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"http://www.computercraft.info\">Visit the official ComputerCraft Website to learn more</a>\n  </p>\n</div>\n",
